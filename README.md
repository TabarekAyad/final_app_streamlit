## Introduction
NCAA March Madness is the annual college basketball tournament organized by the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). It's a single-elimination tournament played each spring in the United States, featuring 68 college basketball teams from the Division I level of the NCAA, to determine the national championship¹.

The tournament was created in 1939 and has become one of the most famous annual sporting events in the United States. The tournament consists of several rounds, named the First Four, First Round, Second Round, Sweet Sixteen, Elite Eight, Final Four, and the National Championship¹.

The "March Madness" name is derived from the particularly intense and exciting games that often occur during the tournament, many of which are played in March. The tournament is widely regarded as one of the most exciting events in sports due to its single-elimination format, which means any team could potentially be eliminated at any stage¹.
